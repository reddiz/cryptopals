Answer for cryptopals challenge that I did

You are welcome to look at the answers, but I strongly suggest that you answer it by yourself first. The challenges is a great way to understand a language, but it's not a problem if you're using a language you're familiar with.

If you hit a brick wall while doing the challenges, you are welcome to study the codes, NOT COPY IT. I strongly suggest that you try to make your own version because it is a great learning practice.

I'm also still not far enough in the challenges, but I'll try to finish it by myself or at the very least, make my own version of the answer.
