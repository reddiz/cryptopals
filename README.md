Answer for cryptopals challenge that I did

If you hit a brick wall while doing the challenges, you are welcome to look at the codes, NOT COPY IT. I strongly suggest that you try to make your own version because it is a great learning practice.

I'm also still not far enough in the challenges, but I'll try to finish it by myself or at the very least, make my own version of the answer.
